run with `cargo run --release`
this will display all the anagram solutions to the anagram problem found
[here](https://followthewhiterabbit.trustpilot.com/cs/step3.html)
the program does an early return, so finding the solution takes more or less time
depending on how lucky you are. On average it takes 10 mins
(I have only tried 5 times, so take my average with some skepticism)

I'm interested in how this program could be made more palatable. Currently it's
a little hard to read I find.
I'm sure there are a couple of macros to generalize some of the things I wrote.
